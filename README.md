ADS 502 Final Project - Predicting Points Scored by Basketball Players in the National Basketball Association

Scoring in the National Basketball Association (NBA) is affected by many factors. Despite the importance of such a critical facet of the game, at the player level, offensive production is difficult to predict. Further, many in-game and in-season variables can affect a single player's scoring output. To address this, we aim to develop a model based on historical player box scores, to find the features that most affect a player's offensive performance and accurately predict their scoring output. We collected player box scores and team averages across the last 10 full seasons. The data was split to validate the model performance of data outside the training set. Based on previous literature, a linear regression model is implemented as the baseline for our research. Later, more advanced algorithms including random forest and gradient-boosted tree algorithms are applied. We provide an overview of the performance of each model in comparison to the baseline model as well as address limitations of the study.
